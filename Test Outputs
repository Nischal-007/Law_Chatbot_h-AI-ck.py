==================================================

Answer:

    Article 16 of the Indian Constitution guarantees equality of opportunity in matters relating to employment or appointment to an office under the State. This provision aims to eliminate any form of discrimination on the grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth, residence or any of them.
    
    However, Article 16 also includes certain exceptions to this general rule of equality of opportunity. These exceptions are provided in Article 16(3), 16(4) and 16(5).
    
    (1) Article 16(3) allows the State to make a law that requires residence within a State or Union territory prior to employment or appointment as an essential qualification.

Query: No one shall be vexed twice for the same cause. Explain the principle and the requirements for its application.
==================================================

Answer:

    The principle you refer to is known as the Doctrine of Res Judicata or the Doctrine of Exhaustion of Remedies.
    
    This doctrine essentially bars a party from raising the same issue in multiple lawsuits. The rationale behind this rule is that it promotes finality and efficiency in the legal system by preventing parties from re-litigating the same issues over and over again.
    
    In order to apply the Doctrine of Res Judicata, there are certain requirements that must be met:
    
    (1) The parties in the current lawsuit must be identical to the parties in the previous lawsuit;
    
    (2) The issue or cause of action currently being litigated must have been raised and decided in the previous lawsuit;
    
    (3) The prior judgment must have become final, either by expiration of the time for appeal or by a decision on appeal.
    
    If these requirements are met, then the Doctrine of Res Judicata applies, and the party seeking to raise the issue again is barred from doing so.
